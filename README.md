Steps to follow:
1) Show on the screen 5 stars (or the icon you like best) centered and with an assigned color
2) That the color of the star changes if the mouse is placed on one of them
3) By moving the mouse over an item, it changes the colors to all its previous ones. If for example it is
put the mouse on the third star, they must change color from 1 to 3.
4) When a star is pressed, the colors must be fixed to it and all of the above
5) If you click on another star, the colors must be updated correctly. Also, if the user clicks out
from the stars area, all must be deselected.
